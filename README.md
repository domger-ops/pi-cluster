### Raspberry Pi 4 Home Server 
update: jan12.23

**Objective:**
I am embarking on the creation of a home server using Raspberry Pi 4 with the primary aim of gaining hands-on experience in networking services. The ultimate goal is to establish an accessible K3s cluster capable of running multiple applications encapsulated within Docker images. This project serves as a practical exploration of containerized environments and networking intricacies, enhancing my skills in the realm of distributed systems and cloud-native applications.

**Hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 8GB
- Case - Heat Sink - Fan - Power Cable w/ switch
- WiFi dongle

**Key Accomplishments**
- Successfully assembled the Pi Server, installed the Ubuntu Server OS, and established SSH connectivity.
- Configured a basic Apache server housing a privately accessible "hello-world" app.
- Implemented and configured K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, for efficient container orchestration.
- Developed a Go Lang web application and conducted thorough testing within the Kubernetes containers.
- Created a Docker Image encapsulating the Go Lang application for streamlined deployment.
- Deployed Docker Images to the containers, ensuring seamless application hosting.
- Secured accessibility within a private network, bolstering privacy and control.
- Established seamless connectivity to the corresponding GitHub repository, fostering version control and collaborative development.

**Goals**
- CI/CD (using Jenkins)
- Publicly accessible (challenge: security)
